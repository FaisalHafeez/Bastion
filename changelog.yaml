changes:
  AMONG US âœ• Bastion:
    - title: Among Us Lobbies
      description: Server members can now create Discord Lobbies for their Among Us party and manage it automatically, using the new `amongUs` command.
    - title: Lobby Channel
      description: Server Managers, don't fret, you can restrict the usage of `amongUs` command to a specific channel using the new `amongUsChannel` command.
    - title: Lobby Restrictions
      description: And lobby hosts, your lobbies are private by default. And you have complete control over whether to allow everyone or only your friends.
  NEW:
    - description: Did you ever want to add a personalized message when giving rep/karma to someone? You can do it now! See `karma --help` for more details.
    - description: You can now give karma/rep anyone simply by thanking them in a message reply. Thank you @Alice for suggesting this! Works even when you mention multiple users.
    - description: Have you ever deleted all the messages from a channel by mistake? I have. So, from now on, `clear` will always ask for confirmation if no `--limit` is explicitly specified.
    - description: Added support back for server wide text muting members in the server with the `--server` flag in the `textMute` command.
    - description: Did you want to go back to Bastion's random greetings and farewells after setting a custom message? Now you can do that by using the `--random` flag with the `greetings` and `farewells` commands respectively.
    - description: Bastion will now give double Experience Points to server members if they are boosting your server.
  CHANGES:
    - description: Temporary voice channels' names will now be based on the name of the user who created it.
    - description: Some optimizations to cache to reduce Bastion's memory usage.
  FIXES:
    - description: Fixed an issue with the `music` command that prevented some servers from show up in the list of all servers where music is enabled.
