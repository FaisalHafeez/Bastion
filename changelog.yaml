changes:
  NEW:
    - description: Have you ever deleted all the messages from a channel by mistake? I have. So, from now on, `clear` will always ask for confirmation if no `--limit` is explicitly specified.
    - description: Added support back for server wide text muting members in the server with the `--server` flag in the `textMute` command.
  CHANGES:
    - description: Temporary voice channels' names will now be based on the name of the user who created it.
    - description: Did you want to go back to Bastion's random greetings and farewells after setting a custom message? Now you can do that by using the `--random` flag with the `greetings` and `farewells` commands respectively.
    - description: Some optimizations to cache to reduce Bastion's memory usage.
  FIXES:
    - description: Fixed an issue with the `music` command that prevented some servers from show up in the list of all servers where music is enabled.
