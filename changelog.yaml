changes:
  New Features:
    - title: Gambling Commands
      description: Gambling commands are now back! `flip`, `roll` and `rps` will allow server members to bet on the outcome, provided gambling is enabled in the server.
    - title: Infractions
      description: If a member violates any filters, it'll be automatically added to their list of infractions.
    - title: Music Activity
      description: You can now configure whether the music activity should be displayed while playing music.
    - title: Role Members
      description: You can now see the members in a role by using the `--members` option with the `role` command.
    - title: "`infractions` command"
      description: The command isn't new, but it has new options that'll allow you to set the thresholds for the infraction actions.
    - title: "`grant` command"
      description: You can now use this new command to grant XP and Coins to all members of your server at once, provided gamification is enabled in the server and profiles for the members have been created.
  Made some improvements:
    - description: The `invite` command can now be used even without the Create Invites permission. Well, it can be used, but it won't create an instant invite for you; it'll only show the invite link to invite Bastion to your server.
  Killed these bugs:
    - description: Some commands' description were missing, found them! They are back at their place now.
    - description: Fixed a rare case when a member's balance had the chance to become the lowest possible negative value when they went into debt. Thank goodness it's fixed, before it affected anyone!
    - description: Fixed some cases where coins transaction logs won't get created.
