changes:
  NEW:
    - title: Captcha Verification
      description: You can now opt to enable Captcha Verification in your server. When enabled, users joining the server would need to solve a captcha in the server's [dashboard](https://bastion.traction.one/dashboard) to verify themselves, and then they'll be assigned the role that was set using the new `verification` command.
  CHANGES:
    - description: `greetings` & `farewells` previews would now show up as embed objects instead of it being rendered.
    - description: Changed an implementation where using `linkFilter` or `inviteFilter` would reset their respective Safe List that was set using the `safeList` command.
  SQUASHED THESE BUGS:
    - description: Fixed an issue where the last streamer was not being removed.
    - description: Some under-the-hood fixes to make Bastion better than ever.
